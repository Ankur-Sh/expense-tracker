# Expense Tracker Application

This repository contains the source code for a full-stack expense tracking application. It features a React-based frontend for a smooth user experience and a Node.js/Express backend to handle data management and API endpoints.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js** , which we'll use to manage dependencies.
* **Git**: Used for version control and cloning the repository. You can get it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

### Cloning the Repository

First, you need to clone the project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

``bash
git clone [https://github.com/Ankur-Sh/expense-tracker.git](https://github.com/Ankur-Sh/expense-tracker.git)
This will create a directory named expense-tracker containing the project files.

Navigating to the Project Directory
Once the cloning is complete, navigate into the project directory using the command line:

Bash

cd expense-tracker
Now you are inside the main project folder. You'll find two important subdirectories here: client (for the React frontend) and server (for the Node.js backend).

Setting up the Frontend (React)
Navigate to the client directory:

Bash

cd client
Install dependencies:

The React frontend relies on various npm packages. Install them by running:

Bash

npm install
This command will download and install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file within the client directory.

Start the frontend development server:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server with:

Bash

npm start
This command will typically open your application in a new tab in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the frontend code will usually be hot-reloaded in the browser.

Setting up the Backend (Node.js/Express)
Navigate back to the root directory and then into the server directory:

Bash

cd ..
cd server
Install dependencies:

The Node.js backend also has its own set of dependencies. Install them using:

Bash

npm install
This will install the packages listed in the package.json file within the server directory.

Configure Environment Variables (if applicable):

Your backend might require certain environment variables for database connections, API keys, etc. Look for a .env.example file (or similar) in the server directory. If you find one, rename it to .env and fill in the necessary values.

Start the backend server:

You can start the Node.js server using a script defined in the package.json file. A common script is start or dev (for development with features like hot-reloading). Try the following:

Bash

node server.js

Check the scripts section in the server/package.json file to see the available commands. The backend server typically runs on a different port, often http://localhost:5000 or a similar port. The console output will usually indicate the port the server is running on.

Running the Application
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, you should be able to access the Expense Tracker application in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:3000). The frontend will communicate with the backend API to fetch and manage your expense data.
